                        <li><strong>Invoicing & Payments:</strong> Use professional invoicing software. Clearly state payment terms (e.g., net 30 days). Consider partial upfront payment for large projects.</li>
                        <li><strong>Taxes:</strong> As a freelancer, you're responsible for your own taxes. Set aside a percentage of your income for self-employment taxes. Consult a tax professional for specific guidance in your region.</li>
                        <li><strong>Copyright:</strong> Understand who owns the copyright to your work. In most freelance situations, you transfer copyright to the client upon full payment (work-for-hire). For your own blog, you retain copyright.</li>
